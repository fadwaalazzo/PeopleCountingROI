# PeopleCountingROI
Counting people in region of interest


- The final purpose of ROI people counting is to judge whether the region is crowd or not crowd. It different from LOI people counting. LOI people counting focuse on the number of people passing through the scene. 
- The most common method of counting people in LOI is deep learning. There maybe some difference between the network deep learning.
